## S19 Summary: YD P3 Design + Artifacts

### What was done
1. Full tool audit: all 27 EdBot + 7 ArtBot tools mapped for GPU tier requirements
2. Confirmed chapter_detect is CPU-only (tier 0) — safe for your 4080
3. Verified existing chapter_detect test coverage (25 tests in tests/test_chapter_detect.py)
4. Wrote P3 test procedure with exact curl commands and expected results
5. Wrote Claude Code prompt you can paste to run P3 semi-autonomously
6. Reviewed your P1 full rerun results (all PASS, good feedback noted)

### Tool Audit Summary
- **CPU-only (tier 0):** 22 tools — chapter_detect, silence_detect, nlp_action, manifest_writer, video_prober, etc.
- **GPU-optional with fallback:** 3 tools — speaker_detect, portrait_crop, tiktok_chunk
- **GPU-required:** 6 tools — transcribe, subtitle_gen, frame_scanner, batch_transcribe, benchmark, executor
- **GPU-offloaded to ComfyUI:** 2 tools — generate, animate

### P3 Scope for You
- chapter_detect: Pure rule-based, zero GPU. Works on all tiers.
- Flow: POST /api/transcribe -> POST /api/silence -> GET /api/chapters
- Your 39s test video should produce 1-2 chapters (min duration default = 30s)
- Also: one-time GPU framework setup (fill config placeholders, run filtered tests)

### P1 Feedback Acknowledged
- Index build gap: noted, will consider /api/build-index endpoint
- Search response missing chunk text: enhancement candidate for future session
- spaCy en_core_web_sm optional: entity_count=0 is acceptable

### Files Pushed

### Next
Waiting for your P3 results. When received:
- S20: Review P3 results, fix issues, design P4 (portrait crop)
