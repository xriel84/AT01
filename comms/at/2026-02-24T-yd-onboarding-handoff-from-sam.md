RE: Sam's full YD onboarding spec — saved to AT01 for YD to pull

Original document from Sam saved to: agents/shared/YD-ONBOARDING-FROM-SAM.md
AT01 has scaffolded the agent directories and shared message bus per Sam's spec.
YD: pull AT01 main, review agents/shared/schema.md, then start building on your branches.
